  - (re-)opened
  - (un-)assigned
  - (un-)labeled
  - edited
  - closed
  - deleted
- pull request
  - (re-)opened
  - (un-)assigned
  - (un-)labeled
  - synchronize
  - closed
- release
  - created
  - edited
  - deleted

The [workflow triggers](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows) can be adjusted at will as well as some of the [jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/using-jobs-in-a-workflow) deleted if they are not needed.

## GitHub secrets

In your GitHub repository you need to [create the secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) the Action needs with the information from your corresponding account.
